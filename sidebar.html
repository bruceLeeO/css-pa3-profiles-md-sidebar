	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>As a child I am very fascinated about how things work and how things are built.  I mostly enjoyed taking toys apart just so I can see and examine what is inside of it.  As an adult I have gone through many different fields of interest but there's always that fascination about building things: I have build libraries of human cDNA clones, turned an empty commercial building space into retail shops and restaurants, constructed residential homes from the ground up, and I even programmed a survey tool that marketing department from a previous job used to generate surveys for fans on the fly.  But my interest has shifted to the internet, seeing beautiful but highly functional website, I can see that there's lots of opportunity to build better and more efficient site, develop apps that people find easy to use, that is my current area of interest.</p>
